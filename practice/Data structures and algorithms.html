                    In computer science, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">data structure</a> is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data,[4] i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

                    In mathematics and computer science, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (audio speaker iconlisten)) is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.[2]
