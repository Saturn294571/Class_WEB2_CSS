                    In theoretical computer science and mathematics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation" title="wikipedia reference">the theory of computation</a> is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree (e.g., approximate solutions versus precise ones). The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?".[1]        </p>
